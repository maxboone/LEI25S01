\section{Support Vector Machines}

The basic intuition is that we want to separate a space
into multiple vectors that represent the center of a cluster
in that space. Then, if we draw a linear model that is orthogonal
to the line between both centers we can use that as a separator.
This works well in convex, non-verlapping distributions of equal
density. The center that is above the line is $\mu^+$ and below
the line is $\mu^-$.

\begin{definition}[Basic Linear Classifier]
  \begin{align*}
    w \times x &= t \\
    w &= \mu^+ - \mu^- \\
    t &= \frac{1}{2} \normv{\mu^+}^2 + \frac{1}{2} \normv{\mu^-}^2
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}
