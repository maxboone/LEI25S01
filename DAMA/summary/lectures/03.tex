\section{Mining Data Streams}

Instead of stored data that is used for off-line analysis
we might sometimes need instant action on results or signals
that we receive. We can use trained models (rules, decision trees,
neural networks, et cetera) in real time. Specifically, we might
be interested in queries over the last $N$ records (sliding window)
or a sample of everything that we have seen so far (i.e. the last $N$ days).
